## Project targets: ##
  * Provide a open source accurate enough LTE/SAE model in NS 2
  * Study the optimization features of TCP based on the model
## User guide: ##
  * Leave your questions/comments in the WiKi page
  * Download the documents from "Downloads"
  * Download the latest code from "Source" (suggest to use SVN)
## Notes: ##
  * This project is ongoing,so the code and documents will be updated every now and then.
  * Part of the project is based on the earlier GPRS project, so some GPRS related documents are also put in the "Downloads" for your reference.
  * Some readers give the feedback that the compilation fails. My development environment is NS 2.33 and Dabian OS.
