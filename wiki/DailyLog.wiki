#summary Record the problem solved and to be solved.

== 2009 Aug. 4 ==
    * modified files: checkin checkout dlairqueue.cc dls1queue.cc
    * dlairqueue.h
     * check flowcontrol is not triggered 
     * timer is not triggered
     * bind the dnode_

== 2009 July 29 HVQ (UE level) ==
  
   * int REDQueue::flow_control() 
     * if queue length < min, return -1; 
     * else if packet drop is true, return 1; else return -1; 
   * DLAirQueue::enque() 
     * after the q3.enque(), p1=q3.flow_control(), if p1==1; mark the HVQ_UE 
   * DLAirQueue::deque() 
     * after the q3.deque(), p1=q3.flow_control(), if p1==-1; demark the HVQ_UE 
   * DLS1Queue::deque() 
     * before q3.deque(), if HVQ is marked, stop sending, try to send after some time. 
 

== 2009 Jul. 7 ==
  * TBD
    * Send the paper for comments from the co-authors
  * Correct problems
    * The streaming traffic problem is caused by wrong defined default value of maximum packet number.
    * lte-model.doc Queue class is updated
    * the test results are got.

== 2009 Jul. 7 ==
  * TBD
    * Streaming traffic doesn't change with the simulation!!
    * lte-model.doc Queue class has some problem.
  * Correct problems
    * Queue limit_ and average packet size in the ns-default.tcl are corrected!
    * Block problem in the flow control is removed
    * The code is zipped in backup.bar for easy download by browser.
